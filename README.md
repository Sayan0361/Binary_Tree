# Binary Tree Operations

This Java program provides a set of operations for a binary tree, including tree creation, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), computing tree height, size, maximum and minimum nodes, sum of all nodes, level order traversal, left view, right view, top view, and bottom view.

## Features

- **Tree Creation:**
  - The user can input data for each node, creating a binary tree.
  
- **Traversals:**
  - In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals are supported.

- **Tree Characteristics:**
  - Height of the tree.
  - Size (number of nodes) of the tree.
  - Maximum and minimum nodes in the tree.
  - Sum of all nodes in the tree.

- **Tree Views:**
  - Level order traversal.
  - Left view of the tree.
  - Right view of the tree.
  - Top view of the tree.
  - Bottom view of the tree.

## Structure

- **`binary_tree.java`:** Main Java file containing the binary tree operations.
- **`Node.java`:** Node class representing a node in the binary tree.
- **`Pair.java`:** Pair class to store the horizontal distance and node information for top and bottom views.

## Dependencies

- The program uses the `Scanner` class for user input.
- The `ArrayList`, `Queue`, `LinkedList`, `Map`, `TreeMap`, and `ArrayDeque` classes are used for various operations.
